# The Jakew Planck Layout

This is a little write up to describe my planck layout's basic features. 

## Inspiration
A big feature of an ortholinear 40% keyboard is that no key is more than two units away from a finger. While this is nice, I have also found physical strain when using my little fingers to press shift and enter, and when reaching for Escape and Backspace.

To compensate, I have used the press for key, hold for modifer in many places, most of which allows me to use my thumbs instead. This has actually improved my typing speed so much that I found I am hitting timeouts in VIM.

I'm a pretty heavy VIM user so you will notice a few things: My arrow keys are located at `hjkl`.

Working in an office environment means needing quick access to be able to pause music, or walk away from my computer, so you will see those buttons as well.  I'm also a macOS user, so many of the short function keys may not work on Windows.

## Qwerty Layer
```
```

A few things to note:
The Escape key doubles as Control when held, and Control doubles as Escape as well. I'm a creature of habbit so, although I try to use the flancking Control key, I do sometimes forget. For consistency, both keys function the same but I'm not entirely sold on this yet.  

Using a thumb for shift is actually one of the easier choices to make. It frees up your fingers to press any key while your thumb does the rest. The placement so close to space can be a bit of an issue at first. I did keep pressing it instead of space for a while.

That being said, I do definitely still forget and use my pinky fingers for shift so they are both present. The right one and the thumb one are also Enter, and I've been tempted to make the left one as well for symetry.

On the same line as thumbs instead of moving hands, the Lower and Raise buttons double as Backspace and Delete respectively. I don't use Tab a lot but if I start, I expect I will likey move it.

## Lower Layer
```
```

The Lower Layer is pretty basic. Symbol keys on the QWERTY row. I have also added multiple types of brackets there for quick access on the home row. I may yet move some of the symbols to be more accessable.

## Raise Layer
```
```
The Raise Layer is similar to the Lower Layer, featuring Numbers instead if Symbols. Although the brackets don't show through, the counter signs of Hyphen and Equal do.
 
## Function Layer
```
```
So named because now all of the number keys are F1 to F10. F11 is where Backspace is and the F12 is wrapped back to the Tab button.'
For ease of use, as many functions are better when they can be used quickly, you can simp;y hold down Space to activate this layer. 

You now also have access to arrow keys in their VIM locations and Next and Previous tab buttons which are handy if you are use to pressing Command + { and Command + } to switch between the. Additionally, the Lock button becomes a Sleep button.

## Adjust Layer
This layer has retained its defaults with the exception of the Dvorak and Colemak removals.
